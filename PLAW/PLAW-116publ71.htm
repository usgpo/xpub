               <p class="lbexIndentSubsection" id="HF57EB27CCB6F4BFC99346F79D180922E">(1)  Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott organized the first Women’s Rights Convention
                  in Seneca Falls, New York. 68 women and 32 men signed the Declaration of Sentiments
                  at the Convention in July 1848.

                  and declared that “all men and women are created equal”, linking women’s rights directly
                  to the founding ideals of the United States.

                  Terrell, Anne Dallas Dudley, Carrie Chapman Catt, Alice Paul, Lucy Burns, Esther Hobart
                  Morris, and many others, conducted over 900 local, State, and Federal campaigns over
                  a 72-year time span to win women the right to vote.

               <p class="lbexIndentSubsection" id="HFB9D12E9AE724A26B8B34843A3DD14F6">(4)  On November 6, 1917, New York granted women the right to vote, which was an act
                  that created momentum for the national movement that culminated in the ratification
                  of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States 3 years later.

               <p class="lbexIndentSubsection" id="H1EE8BE0B2AE246D78F3F98A9DF123A58">(5)  The 19th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States (“The Susan B. Anthony
                  Amendment”) guarantees all United States women the right to vote and was passed by
                  the 66th Congress of the United States on June 4, 1919.

               <p class="lbexIndentSubsection" id="H954595A98C6E47108F9FCB416AC3618D">(6)  On August 9, 1920, right before the ratification period was set to expire, Governor
                  Albert H. Roberts called a special session of the Tennessee General Assembly to consider
                  the amendment. Pro-suffrage and anti-suffrage activists from around the country descended
                  on Nashville, Tennessee, intent on influencing the legislature.

               <p class="lbexIndentSubsection" id="HEA6E9632ACAE42E690ACEB09E9CD8161">(7)  After the amendment was defeated in a 48–48 tie vote, Tennessee State Representative
                  Harry T. Burn from McMinn County cast the deciding favorable vote after receiving
                  a note from his mother, Phoebe Ensminger Burn, imploring him to vote yes for ratification.

               <p class="lbexIndentSubsection" id="H0778F51824754041B1033EB2313BC90F">(8)  On August 18, 1920, Tennessee became the 36th and final State needed to pass
                  the 19th Amendment, ensuring its ratification pursuant to Article V of the Constitution
                  of the United States.

               <p class="lbexIndentSubsection" id="H32F0018725C1427FB5B9A5277D602E2E">(9)  The 19th Amendment was ratified on August 26, 1920, when Secretary of State Bainbridge
                  Colby issued a proclamation announcing it has become part of the Constitution of the
                  United States.

               <p class="lbexIndentSubsection" id="H5AFAFBFE28F94124B51E334A86F57633">(10)  The ratification of the 19th Amendment marked the single largest extension of
                  voting rights in United States history, enfranchising 27,000,000 American women in
                  the United States.
