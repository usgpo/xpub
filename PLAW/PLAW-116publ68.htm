                  section as “NACA”) hired five women to serve as the first “computer pool” at the Langley
                  Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory where those women took on work making calculations
                  that male engineers had made previously.

                  and initially separated those women from their White counterparts in a group known
                  as the “West Area Computers” where the women were restricted to segregated dining
                  and bathroom facilities.
