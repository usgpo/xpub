                     			 the campaign against al Qaeda and the Islamic State of Iraq and al Sham
                     			 (ISIS), and honors the contributions and

                     			 contributions to the counterterrorism, diplomatic, and stabilization
                     			 efforts underway in Syria and Afghanistan;

                     diplomatic

                     			 influence of Russia and Iran in the Middle East and South Asia and

                     negotiated
                     			 resolutions to the on-going conflicts in Syria and Afghanistan on terms
                     			 that respect the rights of innocent civilians and deny safe havens to

                  </p>
                  <p class="lbexIndentParagraph" id="id6dd818b4ec854bec9691f5520006f7d2">(12)  calls upon the Administration to pursue a strategy that sets the conditions
                     for the long-term
                     			 defeat of al Qaeda and ISIS, as well as the protection of regional

                     			 al
                     			 Qaeda and ISIS before initiating any significant withdrawal of United
