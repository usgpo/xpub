               <p style="text-align:left" class="lbexHangWithMargin">Expressing the sense of Congress regarding the execution-style murders of United States
                  citizens
                  			 Ylli, Agron, and Mehmet Bytyqi in the Republic of Serbia in July 1999.
               </p>
               <p class="lbexHangWithMargin" style="text-align:left">Whereas brothers Ylli, Agron, and Mehmet Bytyqi were citizens of the United States,
                  born in
                  			 Chicago, Illinois, to ethnic Albanian parents from what is today the
                  			 Republic of Kosovo, and who subsequently lived in Hampton Bays, New York;
               </p>
               <p class="lbexHangWithMargin" style="text-align:left">Whereas the three Bytyqi brothers responded to the brutality of the conflict associated
                  with
                  			 Kosovo’s separation from the Republic of Serbia and the Federal Republic
                  			 of Yugoslavia of which Serbia was a constituent republic by joining the
                  			 so-called “Atlantic Brigade” of the Kosovo Liberation Army in April 1999;
               </p>
               <p class="lbexHangWithMargin" style="text-align:left">Whereas a Military-Technical Agreement between the Government of Yugoslavia and the
                  North Atlantic
                  			 Council came into effect on June 10, 1999, leading to a cessation of
                  			 hostilities;
               </p>
               <p class="lbexHangWithMargin" style="text-align:left">Whereas the Bytyqi brothers were arrested on June 23, 1999, by Serbian police within
                  the Federal
                  			 Republic of Yugoslavia when the brothers accidently crossed what was then
                  			 an unmarked administrative border while escorting an ethnic Romani family
                  			 who had been neighbors to safety outside Kosovo;
               </p>
               <p class="lbexHangWithMargin" style="text-align:left">Whereas the Bytyqi brothers were jailed for 15 days for illegal entry into the Federal
                  Republic of
                  			 Yugoslavia in Prokuplje, Serbia, until a judge ordered their release on
                  			 July 8, 1999;
               </p>
               <p class="lbexHangWithMargin" style="text-align:left">Whereas instead of being released, the Bytyqi brothers were taken by a special operations
                  unit of
                  			 the Serbian Ministry of Internal Affairs to a training facility near
                  			 Petrovo Selo, Serbia, where all three were executed;
               </p>
               <p class="lbexHangWithMargin" style="text-align:left">Whereas at the time of their murders, Ylli was 25, Agron was 23, and Mehmet was 21
                  years of age;
               </p>
               <p class="lbexHangWithMargin" style="text-align:left">Whereas Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic was removed from office on October 5,
                  2000, following
                  			 massive demonstrations protesting his refusal to acknowledge and accept
                  			 election results the month before;
               </p>
               <p class="lbexHangWithMargin" style="text-align:left">Whereas in the following years, the political leadership of Serbia has worked to strengthen
                  			 democratic institutions, to develop stronger adherence to the rule of law,
                  			 and to ensure respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, including
                  			 as the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia evolved into a State Union of Serbia
                  			 and Montenegro in February 2003, which itself dissolved when both
                  			 republics proclaimed their respective independence in June 2006;
               </p>
               <p class="lbexHangWithMargin" style="text-align:left">Whereas the United States Embassy in Belgrade, Serbia, was informed on July 17, 2001,
                  that the
                  			 bodies of Ylli, Agron, and Mehmet Bytyqi were found with their hands bound
                  			 and gunshot wounds to the back of their heads, buried atop an earlier mass
                  			 grave of approximately 70 bodies of murdered civilians from Kosovo;
               </p>
               <p class="lbexHangWithMargin" style="text-align:left">Whereas Serbian authorities subsequently investigated but never charged those individuals
                  who were
                  			 part of the Ministry of Internal Affairs chain of command related to this
                  			 crime, including former Minister of Internal Affairs Vlajko Stojilkovic,
                  			 Assistant Minister and Chief of the Public Security Department Vlastimir
                  			 Djordjevic, and special operations training camp commander Goran “Guri” Radosavljevic;
               </p>
               <p class="lbexHangWithMargin" style="text-align:left">Whereas Vlajko Stojilkovic died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in April 2002 prior
                  to being
                  			 transferred to the custody of the International Criminal Tribunal for the
                  			 former Yugoslavia where he had been charged with crimes against humanity
                  			 and violations of the laws or customs of war during the Kosovo conflict;
               </p>
               <p class="lbexHangWithMargin" style="text-align:left">Whereas Vlastimir Djordjevic was arrested and transferred to the custody of the International
                  			 Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in June 2007, and sentenced in
                  			 February 2011 to 27 years imprisonment (later reduced to 18 years) for
                  			 crimes against humanity and violations of the laws or customs of war
                  			 committed during the Kosovo conflict;
               </p>
               <p class="lbexHangWithMargin" style="text-align:left">Whereas Goran “Guri” Radosavljevic is reported to reside in Serbia, working as director
                  of a security consulting firm
                  			 in Belgrade, and is a prominent member of the governing political party;
               </p>
               <p class="lbexHangWithMargin" style="text-align:left">Whereas the Secretary of State designated Goran Radosavljevic of Serbia under section
                  7031(c) of
                  			 the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs
                  			 Appropriations Act, 2018 as ineligible for entry into the United States
                  			 due to his involvement in gross violations of human rights;
               </p>
               <p class="lbexHangWithMargin" style="text-align:left">Whereas two Serbian Ministry of Internal Affairs officers, Sretan Popovic and Milos
                  Stojanovic,
                  			 were charged in 2006 for crimes associated with their involvement in the
                  			 detention and transport of the Bytyqi brothers from Prokuplje to Petrovo
                  			 Selo, but acquitted in May 2012 with an appeals court confirming the
                  			 verdict in March 2013;
               </p>
               <p class="lbexHangWithMargin" style="text-align:left">Whereas the Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic promised several high ranking United
                  States
                  			 officials to deliver justice in the cases of the deaths of Ylli, Agron,
                  			 and Mehmet Bytyqi;
               </p>
               <p class="lbexHangWithMargin" style="text-align:left">Whereas no individual has ever been found guilty for the murders of Ylli, Agron, and

               </p>
               <p class="lbexHangWithMargin" style="text-align:left">Whereas no individual is currently facing criminal charges regarding the murder of
