               </p>
               <p class="lbexIndentParagraph" id="HEBD15610877146EFB7398979A93D9D77">(1)  Discrimination can occur on the basis of the sex, sexual orientation, gender
                  identity, or
                  			 pregnancy, childbirth, or a related medical condition of an individual, as
                  			 well as because of sex-based stereotypes. Each of these factors alone can
                  			 serve as the basis for discrimination, and each is a form of sex
                  			 discrimination.
               </p>
               <p class="lbexIndentParagraph" id="H099B963DF1E44331BF86B98EEC76FC90">(2)  A single instance of discrimination may have more than one basis. For example,
                  discrimination
                  			 against a married same-sex couple could be based on the sex stereotype
                  			 that marriage should only be between heterosexual couples, the sexual
                  			 orientation of the two individuals in the couple, or both. Discrimination
                  			 against a pregnant lesbian could be based on her sex, her sexual
                  			 orientation, her pregnancy, or on the basis of multiple factors.
               </p>
               <p class="lbexIndentParagraph" id="H5E7EFB881E664A8881D3587225C0A88D">(3)  Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (referred to as “LGBTQ”) people
                  commonly experience discrimination in securing access to public accommodations—including
                  			 restaurants, senior centers, stores, places of or establishments that
                  			 provide entertainment, health care facilities, shelters, government
                  			 offices, youth service providers including adoption and foster care
                  			 providers, and transportation. Forms of discrimination include the
                  			 exclusion and denial of entry, unequal or unfair treatment, harassment,
                  			 and violence. This discrimination prevents the full participation of LGBTQ
                  			 people in society and disrupts the free flow of commerce.
               </p>
               <p class="lbexIndentParagraph" id="H43AFAFD198534FACBEC02A06E5DCE723">(4)  Women also have faced discrimination in many establishments such as stores and
                  restaurants, and
                  			 places or establishments that provide other goods or services, such as
                  			 entertainment or transportation, including sexual harassment, differential
                  			 pricing for substantially similar products and services, and denial of
                  			 services because they are pregnant or breastfeeding.
               </p>
               <p class="lbexIndentParagraph" id="H8E04F84018A1434A9AE97223B9F54D53">(5)  Many employers already and continue to take proactive steps, beyond those required
                  by some States
                  			 and localities, to ensure they are fostering positive and respectful
                  			 cultures for all employees. Many places of public accommodation also
                  			 recognize the economic imperative to offer goods and services to as many
                  			 consumers as possible.
               </p>
               <p class="lbexIndentParagraph" id="HBCEFECA538294C9498C1220504607805">(6)  Regular and ongoing discrimination against LGBTQ people, as well as women, in
                  accessing public
                  			 accommodations contributes to negative social and economic outcomes, and
                  			 in the case of public accommodations operated by State and local
                  			 governments, abridges individuals’ constitutional rights.
               </p>
               <p class="lbexIndentParagraph" id="HD8C5E6D9DA1A40FDBE013A389EBCD4F0">(7)  The discredited practice known as “conversion therapy” is a form of discrimination
                  that harms LGBTQ people by undermining individuals sense of self
                  			 worth, increasing suicide ideation and substance abuse, exacerbating
                  			 family conflict, and contributing to second class status.
               </p>
               <p class="lbexIndentParagraph" id="H3C36CAF8DBD44FFB8B16FE7312FF43DA">(8)  Both LGBTQ people and women face widespread discrimination in employment and
                  various services,
                  			 including by entities that receive Federal financial assistance. Such
                  			 discrimination—
               </p>
               <p class="lbexIndentSubpar" id="HA8881ABF868A477C864144A83F0914B7">(A)  is particularly troubling and inappropriate for programs and services funded
                  wholly or in part by
                  			 the Federal Government;
               </p>
               <p class="lbexIndentSubpar" id="HA06556F4804B45ED9FB5155BE2E1995A">(B)  undermines national progress toward equal treatment regardless of sex, sexual
                  orientation, or
                  			 gender identity; and
               </p>
               <p class="lbexIndentSubpar" id="H9A8FE02DD8D44A77B5433307B298B9E5">(C)  is inconsistent with the constitutional principle of equal protection under the
                  Fourteenth
                  			 Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.
               </p>
               <p class="lbexIndentParagraph" id="HC5C5A482853F4E3AB0945B30A52C0A50">(9)  Federal courts have widely recognized that, in enacting the Civil Rights Act
                  of 1964, Congress
                  			 validly invoked its powers under the Fourteenth Amendment to provide a
                  			 full range of remedies in response to persistent, widespread, and
                  			 pervasive discrimination by both private and government actors.
               </p>
               <p class="lbexIndentParagraph" id="HD5FC417AB22546D5BD3D6FC5A4EB7EB3">(10)  Discrimination by State and local governments on the basis of sexual orientation
                  or gender identity
                  			 in employment, housing, and public accommodations, and in programs and
                  			 activities receiving Federal financial assistance, violates the Equal
                  			 Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the
                  			 United States. In many circumstances, such discrimination also violates
                  			 other constitutional rights such as those of liberty and privacy under the
                  			 due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
               </p>
               <p class="lbexIndentParagraph" id="HB05F199EB08D4F0A9E3E41C188544B76">(11)  Individuals who are LGBTQ, or are perceived to be LGBTQ, have been subjected
                  to a history and
                  			 pattern of persistent, widespread, and pervasive discrimination on the
                  			 bases of sexual orientation and gender identity by both private sector and
                  			 Federal, State, and local government actors, including in employment,
                  			 housing, and public accommodations, and in programs and activities
                  			 receiving Federal financial assistance. An explicit and comprehensive
                  			 national solution is needed to address such discrimination, which has
                  			 sometimes resulted in violence or death, including the full range of
                  			 remedies available under the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
               </p>
               <p class="lbexIndentParagraph" id="H724C9F351C3A4CDAB2E83AFA4109E4C8">(12)  Numerous provisions of Federal law expressly prohibit discrimination on the
                  basis of sex, and
                  			 Federal agencies and courts have correctly interpreted these prohibitions
                  			 on sex discrimination to include discrimination based on sexual
                  			 orientation, gender identity, and sex stereotypes. In particular, the
                  			 Equal Employment Opportunity Commission correctly interpreted title VII of
                  			 the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in Macy v. Holder, Baldwin v. Foxx, and
                  			 Lusardi v. McHugh.
               </p>
               <p class="lbexIndentParagraph" id="H9A20CA0187C74F7CA4CF91FEF890B6BF">(13)  The absence of explicit prohibitions of discrimination on the basis of sexual
                  orientation and
                  			 gender identity under Federal statutory law has created uncertainty for
                  			 employers and other entities covered by Federal nondiscrimination laws and
                  			 caused unnecessary hardships for LGBTQ individuals.
               </p>
               <p class="lbexIndentParagraph" id="H6A09A808C0714FAE8A617527AF521884">(14)  LGBTQ people often face discrimination when seeking to rent or purchase housing,
                  as well as in
                  			 every other aspect of obtaining and maintaining housing. LGBTQ people in
                  			 same-sex relationships are often discriminated against when two names
                  			 associated with one gender appear on a housing application, and
                  			 transgender people often encounter discrimination when credit checks or
                  			 inquiries reveal a former name.
               </p>
               <p class="lbexIndentParagraph" id="H5AFD7C27258B4A7F94CA7A19029322A5">(15)  National surveys, including a study commissioned by the Department of Housing
                  and Urban
                  			 Development, show that housing discrimination against LGBTQ people is very
                  			 prevalent. For instance, when same-sex couples inquire about housing that
                  			 is available for rent, they are less likely to receive positive responses
                  			 from landlords. A national matched-pair testing investigation found that
                  			 nearly one-half of same-sex couples face adverse, differential treatment
                  			 when seeking elder housing. According to other studies, transgender people
                  			 have half the homeownership rate of non-transgender people and about 1 in
                  			 5 transgender people experience homelessness.
               </p>
               <p class="lbexIndentParagraph" id="H488DEF36FDF241B6901C8281968CFEA7">(16)  As a result of the absence of explicit prohibitions against discrimination on
                  the basis of sexual
                  			 orientation and gender identity, credit applicants who are LGBTQ, or
                  			 perceived to be LGBTQ, have unequal opportunities to establish credit.
                  			 LGBTQ people can experience being denied a mortgage, credit card, student
                  			 loan, or many other types of credit simply because of their sexual
                  			 orientation or gender identity.
               </p>
               <p class="lbexIndentParagraph" id="H43630F841E2A4912BA9CDAD5B248E026">(17)  Numerous studies demonstrate that LGBTQ people, especially transgender people
                  and women, are
                  			 economically disadvantaged and at a higher risk for poverty compared with
                  			 other groups of people. For example, older women in same-sex couples have
                  			 twice the poverty rate of older different-sex couples.
               </p>
               <p class="lbexIndentParagraph" id="H56111A32E3764C1297D394EB6BE2DB30">(18)  The right to an impartial jury of one’s peers and the reciprocal right to jury
                  service are
                  			 fundamental to the free and democratic system of justice in the United
                  			 States and are based in the Bill of Rights. There is, however, an
                  			 unfortunate and long-documented history in the United States of attorneys
                  			 discriminating against LGBTQ individuals, or those perceived to be LGBTQ,
                  			 in jury selection. Failure to bar peremptory challenges based on the
                  			 actual or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity of an individual
                  			 not only erodes a fundamental right, duty, and obligation of being a
                  			 citizen of the United States, but also unfairly creates a second class of
                  			 citizenship for LGBTQ victims, witnesses, plaintiffs, and defendants.
               </p>
               <p class="lbexIndentParagraph" id="HFA25F25B7BBA4101A8E6A4C300FE8E84">(19)  Numerous studies document the shortage of qualified and available homes for
                  the 437,000 youth in
                  			 the child welfare system and the negative outcomes for the many youth who
                  			 live in group care as opposed to a loving home or who age out without a
                  			 permanent family. Although same-sex couples are 7 times more likely to
                  			 foster or adopt than their different-sex counterparts, many child placing
                  			 agencies refuse to serve same-sex couples and LGBTQ individuals. This has
                  			 resulted in a reduction of the pool of qualified and available homes for
                  			 youth in the child welfare system who need placement on a temporary or
                  			 permanent basis. Barring discrimination in foster care and adoption will
                  			 increase the number of homes available to foster children waiting for
                  			 foster and adoptive families.

               <p class="lbexIndentParagraph" id="HE4EC80D89C9244E68526383309ED6308">(20)  LGBTQ youth are overrepresented in the foster care system by at least a factor
                  of two and report
                  			 twice the rate of poor treatment while in care compared to their non-LGBTQ
                  			 counterparts. LGBTQ youth in foster care have a higher average number of
                  			 placements, higher likelihood of living in a group home, and higher rates
                  			 of hospitalization for emotional reasons and juvenile justice involvement
                  			 than their non-LGBTQ peers because of the high level of bias and
                  			 discrimination that they face and the difficulty of finding affirming
                  			 foster placements. Further, due to their physical distance from friends
                  			 and family, traumatic experiences, and potentially unstable living
                  			 situations, all youth involved with child welfare are at risk for being
                  			 targeted by traffickers seeking to exploit children. Barring
                  			 discrimination in child welfare services will ensure improved treatment
                  			 and outcomes for LGBTQ foster children.
