                        evidence on the prevalence of child marriage in humanitarian and fragile settings.
                        For example, in Uganda, the UN Joint Program on Child Marriage helped 27,000 adolescent
                        girls strengthen critical skills through school clubs and Go Back to School campaigns,
                        as well as life skills and financial literacy training.

                        countries, 65,000 people, of whom 45,000 are adolescents, were reached with awareness-raising
                        activities on the harms of child marriage in 2018 alone. As a result, local council
                        representatives, elders, and community leaders from 6 districts signed a pledge to
                        support advocacy efforts to end child marriage.

                        under which amounts are contributed to a custodial account under subparagraph (A)
                        of section 403(b)(7), the plan administrator or custodian may distribute an individual
                        custodial account in kind to a participant or beneficiary of the plan and the distributed
                        custodial account shall be maintained by the custodian on a tax-deferred basis as
                        a section 403(b)(7) custodial account, similar to the treatment of fully-paid individual
                        annuity contracts under Revenue Ruling 2011–7, until amounts are actually paid to
                        the participant or beneficiary. The guidance shall provide further (i) that the section
                        403(b)(7) status of the distributed custodial account is generally maintained if the
                        custodial account thereafter adheres to the requirements of section 403(b) that are
                        in effect at the time of the distribution of the account and (ii) that a custodial
                        account would not be considered distributed to the participant or beneficiary if the
                        employer has any material retained rights under the account (but the employer would
                        not be treated as retaining material rights simply because the custodial account was
                        originally opened under a group contract). Such guidance shall be retroactively effective
