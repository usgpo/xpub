                        a Russian messaging strategy that blends covert intelligence operation—such as cyber
                        activity—with overt efforts by Russian Government agencies, state-funded media, third-party

                        station or provider of cable or satellite television. In 2003, the Supreme Court upheld
                        regulations on electioneering communications established under the Act, noting that

                        or cable provider—has greatly facilitated the scope and effectiveness of disinformation
                        campaigns. For instance, the largest platform has over 210,000,000 Americans users—over
                        160,000,000 of them on a daily basis. By contrast, the largest cable television provider
                        has 22,430,000 subscribers, while the largest satellite television provider has 21,000,000
                        subscribers. And the most-watched television broadcast in United States history had

                        of publicity for any political advertisement. These communications are accessible
                        to the press, fact-checkers, and political opponents; this creates strong disincentives
                        for a candidate to disseminate materially false, inflammatory, or contradictory messages
                        to the public. Social media platforms, in contrast, can target portions of the electorate
                        with direct, ephemeral advertisements often on the basis of private information the
                        platform has on individuals, enabling political advertisements that are contradictory,
                        racially or socially inflammatory, or materially false.

                        A Primer in Russian Active Measures and Influence Campaigns”, multiple expert witnesses
                        testified that while the disinformation tactics of foreign adversaries have not necessarily
                        changed, social media services now provide “platform[s] practically purpose-built
                        for active measures[.]” Similarly, as Gen. Keith B. Alexander (RET.), the former Director
                        of the National Security Agency, testified, during the Cold War “if the Soviet Union
                        sought to manipulate information flow, it would have to do so principally through
                        its own propaganda outlets or through active measures that would generate specific
                        news: planting of leaflets, inciting of violence, creation of other false materials
                        and narratives. But the news itself was hard to manipulate because it would have required
                        actual control of the organs of media, which took long-term efforts to penetrate.
                        Today, however, because the clear majority of the information on social media sites
                        is uncurated and there is a rapid proliferation of information sources and other sites
                        that can reinforce information, there is an increasing likelihood that the information
                        available to average consumers may be inaccurate (whether intentionally or otherwise)
                        and may be more easily manipulable than in prior eras.”.

                     <p class="lbexIndent">Congress finds the following:</p>
                     <p class="lbexIndentParagraph" id="HDA8011B327DA429BBC1C59720E29AF3D">(1)  The American Republic was founded on the principle that all people are created
                        equal, with rights and responsibilities as citizens to vote, be represented, speak,
                        debate, and participate in self-government on equal terms regardless of wealth. To
                        secure these rights and responsibilities, our Constitution not only protects the equal
                        rights of all Americans but also provides checks and balances to prevent corruption
                        and prevent concentrated power and wealth from undermining effective self-government.
                     </p>
                     <p class="lbexIndentParagraph" id="HEBD695E2B47C4B18A20C6899B3E547AE">(2)  The Supreme Court’s decisions in <i>Citizens United</i> v. <i>Federal Election Commission</i>, 558 U.S. 310 (2010) and <i>McCutcheon</i> v. <i>FEC</i>, 572 U.S. 185 (2014), as well as other court decisions, erroneously invalidated even-handed
                        rules about the spending of money in local, State, and Federal elections. These flawed
                        decisions have empowered large corporations, extremely wealthy individuals, and special
                        interests to dominate election spending, corrupt our politics, and degrade our democracy
                        through tidal waves of unlimited and anonymous spending. These decisions also stand
                        in contrast to a long history of efforts by Congress and the States to regulate money
                        in politics to protect democracy, and they illustrate a troubling deregulatory trend
                        in campaign finance-related court decisions. Additionally, an unknown amount of foreign
                        money continues to be spent in our political system as subsidiaries of foreign-based
                        corporations and hostile foreign actors sometimes connected to nation-States work
                        to influence our elections.

                     <p class="lbexIndentParagraph" id="HFD14739B885E449A9114D704D8D1B69F">(3)  The Supreme Court’s misinterpretation of the Constitution to empower monied interests
                        at the expense of the American people in elections has seriously eroded over 100 years
                        of congressional action to promote fairness and protect elections from the toxic influence
                        of money.
                     </p>
                     <p class="lbexIndentParagraph" id="HDD8A24DFD88349B5AC0EA7230A94F182">(4)  In 1907, Congress passed the Tillman Act in response to the concentration of
                        corporate power in the post-Civil War Gilded Age. The Act prohibited corporations
                        from making contributions in connection with Federal elections, aiming “not merely
                        to prevent the subversion of the integrity of the electoral process [but] * * * to
                        sustain the active, alert responsibility of the individual citizen in a democracy
                        for the wise conduct of government”.

                     <p class="lbexIndentParagraph" id="H645BD64936284EFCA14EAA7461935C78">(5)  By 1910, Congress began passing disclosure requirements and campaign expenditure
                        limits, and dozens of States passed corrupt practices Acts to prohibit corporate spending
                        in elections. States also enacted campaign spending limits, and some States limited
                        the amount that people could contribute to campaigns.
                     </p>
                     <p class="lbexIndentParagraph" id="H677F18885393432AA85EDD4604949818">(6)  In 1947, the Taft-Hartley Act prohibited corporations and unions from making
                        campaign contributions or other expenditures to influence elections. In 1962, a Presidential
                        commission on election spending recommended spending limits and incentives to increase
                        small contributions from more people.
                     </p>
                     <p class="lbexIndentParagraph" id="H8E7A6E2D113B4FA597115EA887FF967B">(7)  The Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (FECA), as amended in 1974, required
                        disclosure of contributions and expenditures, imposed contribution and expenditure
                        limits for individuals and groups, set spending limits for campaigns, candidates,
                        and groups, implemented a public funding system for Presidential campaigns, and created
                        the Federal Election Commission to oversee and enforce the new rules.
                     </p>
                     <p class="lbexIndentParagraph" id="HBB4B3D1E6E2D49DB81AC98FBD7E93051">(8)  In the wake of <i>Citizens United</i> and other damaging Federal court decisions, Americans have witnessed an explosion
                        of outside spending in elections. Outside spending increased nearly 900 percent between
                        the 2008 and 2016 Presidential election years. Indeed, the 2018 elections once again
                        made clear the overwhelming political power of wealthy special interests, to the tune
                        of over $5,000,000,000. And as political entities adapt to a post-<i>Citizens United</i>, post-<i>McCutcheon</i> landscape, these trends are getting worse, as evidenced by the experience in the
                        2018 midterm congressional elections, where outside spending more than doubled from
                        the previous midterm cycle.
                     </p>
                     <p class="lbexIndentParagraph" id="H0C5AA21A48AA4C669CDF18A430EAD6F9">(9)  The torrent of money flowing into our political system has a profound effect
                        on the democratic process for everyday Americans, whose voices and policy preferences
                        are increasingly being drowned out by those of wealthy special interests. The more
                        campaign cash from wealthy special interests can flood our elections, the more policies
                        that favor those interests are reflected in the national political agenda. When it
                        comes to policy preferences, our Nation’s wealthiest tend to have fundamentally different
                        views than do average Americans when it comes to issues ranging from unemployment
                        benefits to the minimum wage to health care coverage.
                     </p>
                     <p class="lbexIndentParagraph" id="H652093CB1146491DBB6DF8755136FFD3">(10)  The Court has tied the hands of Congress and the States, severely restricting
                        them from setting reasonable limits on campaign spending. For example, the Court has
                        held that only the Government’s interest in preventing quid pro quo corruption, like
                        bribery, or the appearance of such corruption, can justify limits on campaign contributions.
                        More broadly, the Court has severely curtailed attempts to reduce the ability of the
                        Nation’s wealthiest and most powerful to skew our democracy in their favor by buying
                        outsized influence in our elections. Because this distortion of the Constitution has
                        prevented truly meaningful regulation or reform of the way we finance elections in
                        America, a constitutional amendment is needed to achieve a democracy for all the people.
                     </p>
                     <p class="lbexIndentParagraph" id="H4DED4B290FE74E8D8235E05329516C96">(11)  Since the landmark <i>Citizens United</i> decision, 19 States and nearly 800 municipalities, including large cities like New
                        York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Philadelphia, have gone on record supporting a constitutional
                        amendment. Transcending political leanings and geographic location, voters in States
                        and municipalities across the country that have placed amendment questions on the
                        ballot have routinely supported these initiatives by considerably large margins.
                     </p>
                     <p class="lbexIndentParagraph" id="H2F7AEE92D4AF4150BE476EE691737023">(12)  At the same time millions of Americans have signed petitions, marched, called
                        their Members of Congress, written letters to the editor, and otherwise demonstrated
                        their public support for a constitutional amendment to overturn <i>Citizens United</i> that will allow Congress to reign in the outsized influence of unchecked money in
                        politics. Dozens of organizations, representing tens of millions of individuals, have
                        come together in a shared strategy of supporting such an amendment.
                     </p>
                     <p class="lbexIndentParagraph" id="HFED2D67D7BB84E7C86581C5AC33654D7">(13)  In order to protect the integrity of democracy and the electoral process and
                        to ensure political equality for all, the Constitution should be amended so that Congress
                        and the States may regulate and set limits on the raising and spending of money to
                        influence elections and may distinguish between natural persons and artificial entities,
                        like corporations, that are created by law, including by prohibiting such artificial
                        entities from spending money to influence elections.

                        would exist whether or not a candidate were running for office, like childcare and
                        food. While the law seems neutral, its actual effect is to privilege the independently
                        wealthy who want to run, because given the demands of running for office, candidates
                        who must work to pay for childcare or to afford health insurance are effectively being
                        left out of the process, even if they have sufficient support to mount a viable campaign.

                        rely on a regular paycheck to make ends meet. The consequence is that everyday Americans
                        who have firsthand knowledge of the importance of stable childcare, a safety net,
                        or great public schools are less likely to get a seat at the table. This governance
                        by the few is antithetical to the democratic experiment, but most importantly, when
                        lawmakers do not share the concerns of everyday Americans, their policies reflect
                        that.

                        everyday Americans. The New York Times reported in 2019 that fewer than 5 percent
                        of representatives cite blue-collar or service jobs in their biographies. A 2015 survey
                        by the Center for Responsive Politics showed that the median net worth of lawmakers
                        was just over $1 million in 2013, or 18 times the wealth of the typical American household.
                     </p>
                     <p class="lbexIndentParagraph" id="H2934C6B6CFCF4DD380126A476F8ACF40">(5)  These circumstances have also contributed to a governing body that does not reflect
                        the nation it serves. For instance, women are 51% of the American population. Yet
                        even with a record number of women serving in the One Hundred Sixteenth Congress,
                        the Pew Research Center notes that more than three out of four Members of this Congress
                        are male. The Center for American Women And Politics found that one third of women
                        legislators surveyed had been actively discouraged from running for office, often
                        by political professionals. This type of discouragement, combined with the prohibitions
                        on using campaign funds for domestic needs like childcare, burdens that still fall
                        disproportionately on American women, particularly disadvantages working mothers.
                        These barriers may explain why only 10 women in history have given birth while serving
                        in Congress, in spite of the prevalence of working parents in other professions. Yet
                        working mothers and fathers are best positioned to create policy that reflects the
                        lived experience of most Americans.
                     </p>
                     <p class="lbexIndentParagraph" id="HD1DEA537B62245AF8D48DEF65D75484D">(6)  Working mothers, those caring for their elderly parents, and young professionals
                        who rely on their jobs for health insurance should have the freedom to run to serve
                        the people of the United States. Their networks and net worth are simply not the best
                        indicators of their strength as prospective public servants. In fact, helping ordinary
                        Americans to run may create better policy for all Americans.
